# GAIA-QAO - The Unified Aerospace Vanguard Nexus

*Orchestrating identity, ethics, and operational intelligence across **Air ✈️ · Space 🛰️ · Greentech 🌱.***

---

## 🌍 Overview

**GAIA-QAO** is a federated platform that synchronises **ethical AI profiles, operational data, and semantic intent** for aerospace and green-tech ecosystems.  
It exposes a **FederatedProfileSync API** that lets agents-human or machine-carry their identity and context fluidly between closed industrial systems (MRO, SCADA, PLM) and public large-language-model interfaces.

---

## ❓ Why does it matter?

- **Context continuity** - Engineers, pilots and mission operators avoid “cold-start” conversations with AI assistants.  
- **Ethical coherence** - PET-CORE signatures ensure every agent respects common safety & sustainability norms.  
- **Operational speed** - Secure webhooks push critical state changes (e.g., APU faults, orbital events) to every subscribed agent in real time.

---

## 🛠 Problem it solves

1. **Data silos** between OEMs, airlines, space agencies and sustainability partners.  
2. **Fragmented AI memory**-each AI platform learns your context in isolation, causing inconsistency.  
3. **Regulatory pressure** for traceable, auditable AI decisions (EASA AI.01, EU AI Act, NASA-STD-7009).  

**GAIA-QAO** unifies these gaps with a portable, auditable identity bus.

## 💹 Potential ROI

| Domain         | Efficiency Gain                         | Monetisable Outcome                         |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Airline Ops    | ↓ 12 % AOG time via shared predictive context | ≈ $1.8 M / year / mid-size fleet           |
| Space Missions | ↓ 25 % anomaly-triage hours            | Launch cost savings & extended payload life |
| GreenTech      | ↑ 15 % material traceability           | Premium ESG credits, investor confidence    |

*Model based on early simulations with three partner datasets; detailed financial model in `docs/roi-model.xlsx` (to-be-added).*

## 🌱 Return for Community & Environment

- **Open-source core** under GPL-3.0-plus.  
- **PET-CORE green metrics** baked into every agent interaction.  
- **2 % of gross subscription revenue** is earmarked for reforestation & STEM scholarships.
